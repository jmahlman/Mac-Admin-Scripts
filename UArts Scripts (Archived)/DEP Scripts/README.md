# DEP scripts

These scripts are used for our DEP deployments.  There are two because one (the FACSTAFF one) was a proof of concept and the PUBLIC
one was made after.

For more information on how to use these you can head over to my [blog post](https://yearofthegeek.net/2018/05/updating-our-depnotify-process/) about it.  There is also a presentation video from the
Greater Philadelphia MacAdmins [here](https://youtu.be/Jk5Snii-nWA?t=32m40s).

Eventually, these scripts will be merged into one deployment method.  You can find that repo [here](https://github.com/jmahlman/DEPNotify-automated).
